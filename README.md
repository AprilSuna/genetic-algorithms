# genetic-algorithms
Implementation of simple, migration and diffusion models of genetic algorithms (GA).

## Goals
* implement a simple GA
* implement a migration model of GA (parallel or sequential)
* implement a diffusion model of GA (parallel or sequential)
* implement several types of selection, mutation and crossover operations
  * diffusion model must have at least 1 type of those operations
* build project as python package
* documentation + doctest (sphinx etc.)
* important parts of code must be tested (pytest etc.)
* bonus: implementation quality will be tested by Black-Box Optimization Benchmarking (BBOB) on platform [COCO](http://coco.gforge.inria.fr/) or by similar tools
* bonus: publish project on [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi)
